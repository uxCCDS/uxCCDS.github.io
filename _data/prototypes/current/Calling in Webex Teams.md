# Summary

๏ We are using the word meet for both a meeting and a call in today’s client. This could be confusing to the end user.

๏ Now that calling is becoming a significant part of the client the difference in a call and meeting is even more important.

๏ Use of the video Icon for ‘meet’ is confusing. A call or a meeting can have both video and audio.

Our research objective is to evaluate and understand users perception of what a call versus a meeting is in the Webex Teams app and to gain insight into what direction the Teams client is to take when adopting Unified Calling capabilities.

# Instructions

With the desktop prototype, we tested the following features in different user testing sessions, each with 4 to 6 participants. All participants have prior experience with web conferencing tools such as Skype for Business, Webex, and Gotomeetings.

# Results of Testing

• A clear direction of where we should take the Teams client when bringing in calling features

• Identify users mental models around calling and meetings

• Uncover any improvements that can be made for the client itself

• Identify potential gaps in the user experience
