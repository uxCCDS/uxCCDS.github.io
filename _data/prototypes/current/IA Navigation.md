# Summary
With the desktop prototype, we tested the following features in different user testing sessions, each with 4 to 6 participants. All participants have prior experience with web conferencing tools such as Skype for Business, Webex, and Gotomeetings. The tasks including Frist time experiece (FTE), use phone for audio (PSTN), scheduling flow, and the filter functions

We also tested the idea of "team" and "space" to see whether the design fits the users mental model. Most users were able to utilize the filter to facilitate the Team, but the "team" v.s. "space" idea still seemed confusing to others. 

In tasks testing whether the users understand the global scheduling function v.s. the in-space scheduling function, we found that most users tend to schedule the meeting from existing spaces, rather than starting with the global activity button.

For the mobile prototype, we had on-site testees to test the new IA navigation. With a lot less elements available in the new IA (comparing to the existing app), some users found it took them longer to navigate through the app smoothly. We also tested the idea of jumping in and out of a spaces for different tasks.

# Instructions

## On Desktop

1) Use Chrome browser to view the prototype to see the self-view video working

2) Choose Day 1 to test first time experience (FTE)

3) Choose Day 2 to experience OBPT, PSTN (press 1 to trigger OBTP), and joining a team space

## On Mobile

1) You can visit this prototype by using Chrome(Mobile Simulator) or installing it as a web app on iOS devices (The prototype currently only works for 4.7" and 5.5" devices) 
*[How to use Chrome Mobile Simulator](https://uxccds.github.io/prototypes/faq/chrome's-mobile-simulator.html)*  
*[How to Install Web App](https://uxccds.github.io/prototypes/faq/install-web-app.html)*

2) The users can experience the brief sign-on flow and get to the Day1 Scenario.

3) Long tap (at least 2 seconds) on the empty space in Day 1 view (or move cursor if using a browser Simulator) to get to the Day 2 flow.

4) Note to Simulator users: elemement alignment might be off using the simuulator, as we modified the prototype to adapt to a better experience on iOS devices.

# Key Findings

1) Users defined Cisco Spark as a collaboration tool

2) Confusion still exists in diffrienciating "Space" v.s. "Activities"

3) Switching spaces during a call caused confusion for first time users

4) Join meeting with video fits the users' mental model

5) Join with audio, especially in PSTN situation confused the users

# User Testing

## Tested Features:

**Desktop**

1) Coachmarks (First use scenario) - whether people read the coachmarks and whether the coachmarks help them to navigate through the app easier **(feature not shown in this current PT)**

2) Global v.s. Local activities concept

3) Getting to understand how easy/difficult it is for the users to contact someone through the app as a first-time user

4) Overall experience for OBTP and PSTN

5) OBTP Toast - Whether the toast makes sense to the users

6) Filters - Discoverablility and whether the user understand the concept differences between teams and spaces

7) Scheduling - Global scheduling v.s. In-space scheduling

8) Meeting List / My Stuff


**Mobile**

1) Navigation

2) Global v.s In-Space activities

3) My Stuff and teams
