# Instructions

## On Desktop

1) Use Chrome browser to view the prototype to see the self-view video working

2) Choose Day 1 to test the coachmark experience

3) Choose Day 2 to experience OBPT and PSTN (press 1 to trigger OBTP)

## On Mobile

1) You can visit this prototype by using Chrome(Mobile Simulator) or installing it as a web app on IOS  
*[How to use Chrome Mobile Simulator](https://uxccds.github.io/prototypes/faq/chrome's-mobile-simulator.html)*  
*[How to Install Web App](https://uxccds.github.io/prototypes/faq/install-web-app.html)*

2) The prototype is set up for a new user defaultly.

3) Keep pressing(mousemoving in Simulator) for 2 seconds at the buttom of the space list will add spaces for Day 2 flow.

4) Some screens with input box will have some position issue on Simulator, because we want it runs better on IOS.

# Key Findings

1) Users defined Cisco Spark as a collaboration tool

2) Confusion still exists in diffrienciating "Space" v.s. "Activities"

3) Switching spaces during a call caused confusion for first time users

4) Join meeting with video fits the users' mental model

5) Join with audio, especially in PSTN situation confused the users

# User Testing

## Tested Features:

1) Coachmarks (First use scenario) - whether people read the coachmarks and whether the coachmarks help them to navigate through the app easier

2) Global v.s. Local activities concept

3) Getting to understand how easy/difficult it is for the users to contact someone through the app as a first-time user

4) Overall experience for OBTP and PSTN

5) OBTP Toast - Whether the toast makes sense to the users
