# Summary
With this prototype, we tested the following features in two different user testing sessions, each with 4 to 6 participants. All participants have prior experience with web conferencing tools such as Skype for Business, Webex, and Gotomeetings.

**Tested Features:

1) Coachmarks (First use scenario) - whether people read the coachmarks and whether the coachmarks help them to navigate through the app easier

2) Global v.s. Local activities concept

3) Getting to understand how easy/difficult it is for the users to contact someone through the app as a first-time user

4) Overall experience for OBTP and PSTN

5) OBTP Toast - Whether the toast makes sense to the users

# Instructions

### On Desktop

1) Use Chrome browser to view the prototype to see the self-view video working

2) Choose Day 1 to test the coachmark experience

3) Choose Day 2 to experience OBPT and PSTN (press 1 to trigger OBTP)

# Key Findings

1) Users defined Cisco Spark as a collaboration tool
2) Confusion still exists in diffrienciating "Space" v.s. "Activities"
3) Switching spaces during a call caused confusion for first time users
4) Join meeting with video fits the users' mental model
5) Join with audio, especially in PSTN situation confused the users
