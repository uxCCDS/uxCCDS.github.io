1) **Pin to top** - Right click on people/spaces conversations to see this function. All pinned messages will show at the top of the list

2) **Tag filters** - These filters only show when relevant conversation status (e.g. unread, @mention, or draft) are available. 

3) **Notification settings** - @mentions or All messages
